# Sheet Grabber

Sheet Grabber is an Express.js application designed to fetch data from Google Sheets using Google Sheets API. It provides a secure way to access the contents of specific spreadsheets by requiring an API key for operations.

## Features

- **API Key Authentication:** Ensures that only requests with a valid API key can access the Google Sheets data.
- **Google Sheets API Integration:** Leverages the Google Sheets API to read spreadsheet data dynamically based on requests.
- **Environment Variables:** Uses environment variables to handle sensitive data securely.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the application, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

Additionally, you will need:
- A Google Cloud Platform account.
- Access to the Google Sheets API.
- A service account on Google Cloud with permission to access Google Sheets, and its corresponding JSON key file.

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
